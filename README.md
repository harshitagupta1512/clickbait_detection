## Objective
Implement a deep similarity-aware attentive model to capture and represent similarities between the misleading titles and the target content with better expressiveness.

Evaluate the effectiveness of the model on two real world datasets and compare it with series of baseline and state-of-the-arts methods.

## Methodology

The paper implements this task by following the framework of three parts: 
1) Learning latent representations, 
2) Learning the similarities,
3) Using the similarity for further predictions.
